Creative Computer: Bugs is an addition to [Create](https://github.com/Creators-of-Create/Create) and [CC: Tweaked](https://github.com/cc-tweaked/CC-Tweaked), which plans to add some intelligent bugs. These bugs can infect specific blocks/entities. Special computers (have apis) carried by the bugs allow player to control the blocks/entities.

### With these apis, you can: 
1. Let the mechanical arm adjust the place targets and retrieval targets on its own.
2. Use the bug computer (worm) inside the machine to collect production data from various machines in your factory, truly realizing big data without taking up any valuable space in your factory (needn't block form computer).
3. Transform your nearby zombie spawner into a bot production base and command your zombie army to attack your friend's house.
4. Hire(force) villagers to work in your Create factory.
5. Make bosses such as an ender dragon, wither, truly become your pets, ridden, and fully configurable to expand their behavior (of course, you need to write it yourself).
6. Enable AI such as ChatGPT and Deepseek to integrate into your factory / the specific mob, allowing AI to automatically adjust factory production capacity (further, command your "workers" to transform the factory to increase production capacity).

The above is based on the ideas of this mod, CC: Tweaked, and other mods. The specific content certainly needs to be developed using CC's powerful programming language Lua(although uncomfortable).
